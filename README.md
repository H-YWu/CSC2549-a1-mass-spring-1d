## Introduction

Welcome to Physics-Based Animation. This assignment has two purposes, (1) to familiarize you with the development tools used for assignments in the course and (2) to introduce you to some basic physics simulation concepts in one-dimension (1D).  

### Prerequisite installation

On all platforms, we will assume you have installed cmake and a modern c++
compiler on Mac OS X[¹](#¹macusers), Linux[²](#²linuxusers), or
Windows[³](#³windowsusers).

We also assume that you have cloned this repository using the `--recursive`
flag (if not then issue `git submodule update --init --recursive`). 

**Note:** We only officially support these assignments on Ubuntu Linux 18.04 (the OS the teaching labs are running) and OSX 10.13 (the OS I use on my personal laptop). While they *should* work on other operating systems, we make no guarantees. 

**All grading of assignments is done on Linux 18.04**

### Layout

All assignments will have a similar directory and file layout:

    README.md
    CMakeLists.txt
    main.cpp
    include/
      function1.h
      function2.h
      ...
    src/
      function1.cpp
      function2.cpp
      ...
    data/
      ...
    ...

The `README.md` file will describe the background, contents and tasks of the
assignment.

The `CMakeLists.txt` file setups up the cmake build routine for this
assignment.

The `main.cpp` file will include the headers in the `include/` directory and
link to the functions compiled in the `src/` directory. This file contains the
`main` function that is executed when the program is run from the command line.

The `include/` directory contains one file for each function that you will
implement as part of the assignment.

The `src/` directory contains _empty implementations_ of the functions
specified in the `include/` directory. This is where you will implement the
parts of the assignment.

The `data/` directory contains _sample_ input data for your program. Keep in
mind you should create your own test data to verify your program as you write
it. It is not necessarily sufficient that your program _only_ works on the given
sample data.

## Compilation

This and all following assignments will follow a typical cmake/make build
routine. Starting in this directory, issue:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..

If you are using Mac or Linux, then issue:

    make

If you are using Windows, then running `cmake ..` should have created a Visual Studio solution file
called `a1-mass-spring-1d.sln` that you can open and build from there. Building the raster project will generate an .exe file.

Why don't you try this right now?

## Execution

Once built, you can execute the assignment from inside the `build/` using 

    ./a1-mass-spring-1d
